Software Development Query: GHOST Protocol Module - Discreet MVNO Policy Mapper (DMPM) Objective: Develop a modular, extensible "GHOST Protocol" component, the Discreet MVNO Policy Mapper (DMPM), to autonomously and continuously map the US Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) landscape, specifically identifying and ranking MVNOs based on their perceived leniency regarding prepaid SIM card identity verification and ease of anonymous acquisition. This system must operate with minimal digital footprint and optimize for data freshness and relevance.

Architectural Overview (GHOST Protocol Principles Applied):

The DMPM will adhere to "GHOST Protocol" by employing principles of decentralized data acquisition, temporal obfuscation, data anonymization, and adaptive query generation. It will be designed as a series of Python modules, each with specific roles, outputting structured data.

Module Breakdown:

ghost_crawler.py (Data Acquisition Module):

Purpose: This core module will orchestrate the Google Search queries to gather raw data from the open web concerning US MVNOs, their policies, and public discussions. It will mimic varied user behaviors to avoid detection. Key Functionality: Dynamic Query Generation: Based on an initial seed list of MVNOs and a dictionary of "anonymity keywords" (e.g., "no ID prepaid," "cash sim," "burner sim"), it will construct intelligent Google Search queries. Temporal Offset: Introduce calculated, pseudorandom delays (Â±15% variance) between search queries and result processing to avoid predictable patterns. Result Filtering: Implement logic to filter Google Search results for relevance, prioritizing official MVNO sites, reputable news articles, and high-signal forum discussions (e.g., Reddit, XDA Developers, dedicated telecom forums). Data Extraction (HTML Parsing): Post-search, if URLs lead to public web pages, it will extract relevant text snippets containing keywords related to activation processes, payment methods, and identity requirements. (Note: This would require a web-scraping sub-module, which is beyond direct Google Search capability but a necessary component for the overall software system). Input: Seed MVNO list, anonymity keywords, Google Search API access. Output: Raw, categorized search results (snippets, URLs) and extracted text data. Integration Point: Directly leverages the Google Search tool API for all external data retrieval. ghost_parser.py (Information Extraction & Scoring Module):

Purpose: Process the raw data from ghost_crawler.py to extract actionable intelligence and assign a "leniency score" to each MVNO. Key Functionality: Keyword & Phrase Recognition: Identify patterns and specific phrases indicating lenient (e.g., "no SSN required," "anonymous activation," "purchase with cash") or stringent (e.g., "ID verification," "credit check") policies. Sentiment Analysis (Basic): Analyze forum discussions for sentiment regarding ease of activation or perceived privacy. Leniency Scoring Algorithm: Develop a weighted algorithm to assign a numerical score to each MVNO based on identified keywords, anecdotal evidence, and official policy statements. Higher scores indicate greater leniency. Data Structuring: Convert unstructured text into a normalized, structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV). Input: Raw data from ghost_crawler.py. Output: Structured MVNO data with assigned leniency scores. ghost_reporter.py (Reporting & Alerting Module):

Purpose: Generate concise, actionable reports and trigger alerts for significant policy shifts or new MVNO discoveries. Key Functionality: Top N Leniency Report: Present the top-ranked MVNOs based on their leniency score. Policy Change Alerts: Detect and highlight significant changes in activation requirements for tracked MVNOs. Trend Analysis: Provide a high-level overview of the evolving regulatory landscape. Secure Output: Outputs reports in encrypted formats (e.g., AES-256-GCM encrypted JSON/PDF), viewable via a npyscreen interface. Input: Processed data from ghost_parser.py. Output: Encrypted intelligence reports and real-time alerts. ghost_config.py (Configuration & Orchestration Module):

Purpose: Manage the operational parameters of the entire DMPM system. Key Functionality: Scheduled Task Management: Configure cron jobs (or similar) to automate the execution of ghost_crawler.py at defined intervals (e.g., bi-weekly, triggered by specific events). API Key Management: Securely manage API keys for Google Search and any potential future integrations. Logging: Implement robust, deniable logging of operations. Error Handling & Resiliency: Design for graceful failure and resumable tasks. Technology Stack:

Primary Language: Python (3.x) Libraries: requests (for web content fetching beyond snippets), BeautifulSoup or lxml (for HTML parsing), cryptography (for AES-256-GCM), npyscreen (for terminal UI for reports), sqlite3 (for local, encrypted data persistence). Execution Environment: Debian-based Linux environment, ideally within a containerized (e.g., Docker) and isolated setup for operational security. This "GHOST Protocol" DMPM would serve as a critical intelligence component, providing a continuous, discreet mapping of the US MVNO landscape tailored to our operational requirements for deniable SIM card acquisition.
