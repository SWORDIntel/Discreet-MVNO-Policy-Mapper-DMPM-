## 🎯 Overview
The GHOST Protocol Discreet MVNO Policy Mapper (DMPM) is an automated intelligence gathering system designed to continuously map the US Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) landscape. It identifies and ranks MVNOs based on their perceived leniency regarding prepaid SIM card identity verification and the ease of anonymous acquisition. The system operates with a minimal digital footprint, optimizing for data freshness and relevance, and aims to provide actionable intelligence for privacy-conscious users and security researchers.

Key use cases include:
- Identifying MVNOs with low barriers to anonymous SIM card activation.
- Tracking policy changes related to identity verification across various MVNOs.
- Supporting research into MVNO operational security and privacy practices.
- Providing data for risk assessment in scenarios requiring untraceable communications.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get GHOST DMPM up and running in three simple steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/ghost-dmpm.git # Replace username/ghost-dmpm with the actual repository path
    cd ghost-dmpm
    ```
2.  **Launch with Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
3.  **Explore the Dashboard:**
    Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.
    (Default login: `commander` / `ghost_protocol_2024` - It's crucial to change these in `config/ghost_config.json` or `ghost_dashboard.py` for any non-testing use!)

This sequence starts all GHOST DMPM services, including the web dashboard and the MCP server for AI integration. The system will automatically initiate its first intelligence gathering cycle using default settings.

## ✨ Features
The GHOST DMPM system offers a comprehensive suite of features for MVNO policy intelligence:

-   **Real-time MVNO Policy Tracking**: Continuously gathers and updates information on MVNO policies using automated web crawling.
-   **Leniency Scoring Algorithm**: Ranks MVNOs based on a configurable algorithm that assesses the ease of anonymous SIM acquisition.
-   **Natural Language Queries via MCP**: Interact with the system using natural language through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, enabling AI assistant integration.
-   **AI Assistant Integration**: Designed for easy integration with AI platforms like OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini. See [AI Integration Guide](docs/Integration.md).
-   **Automated Alerts and Reporting**: Generates regular intelligence briefs and can be configured for real-time alerts on significant policy changes.
-   **Predictive Analytics**: Employs analytics to forecast potential policy shifts and identify emerging trends (via `ghost_analytics.py`).
-   **Multi-format Exports**: Export gathered intelligence and reports in various formats including CSV, JSON, and PDF (via `ghost_export.py`).
-   **Webhook Notifications**: Send alerts and updates to Slack, Discord, Email, and MS Teams (via `ghost_webhooks.py`).
-   **Scheduled Operations**: Automate intelligence cycles, report generation, and notifications using a flexible scheduler (via `ghost_scheduler.py`).
-   **Modular Design**: Core components (crawler, parser, reporter, database, dashboard, analytics, webhooks, export, scheduler) are built as distinct Python modules for flexibility and scalability.
-   **Data Persistence**: Stores processed MVNO data, policy changes, and crawl history in an SQLite database.
-   **Encrypted Reporting**: Option to generate intelligence reports in an encrypted format.
-   **Web Dashboard**: Provides a Flask-based web interface to view key findings, system status, and manage operations.
-   **Dockerized Deployment**: Includes Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml` for easy, consistent, and secure deployment.
-   **Security Conscious**: Emphasizes secure API key handling, encrypted outputs, and provides security guidelines.

## 📦 Installation
GHOST DMPM can be installed manually or deployed using Docker. Docker is recommended for ease of use and consistency.

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.9+
*   Docker & Docker Compose (for Docker deployment)
*   Git
*   Build essentials (e.g., `build-essential python3-dev` on Debian)
*   (Optional) Access to Google Search API for `live` mode.

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
This is the quickest and most reliable way to get GHOST DMPM running.

1.  **Clone the repository:** (If not already done)
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd ghost-dmpm
    ```
2.  **Build and start services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
3.  **Access:**
    *   Dashboard: `http://localhost:5000`
    *   MCP Server: `ws://localhost:8765`
4.  **Stop services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

### Option 2: Manual Installation
1.  **Clone and set up environment:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd ghost-dmpm
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Initialize Configuration and Directories:**
    ```bash
    mkdir -p data logs reports test_output config templates
    # Run python ghost_config.py to generate default config if needed
    ```
4.  **Run application components as needed:**
    *   `python main.py` (Full cycle)
    *   `python ghost_dashboard.py` (Dashboard)
    *   `python ghost_mcp_server.py` (MCP Server)


### Option 3: Cloud Deployment
Guidance for deploying to cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure will be provided in future documentation.

## 🔧 Configuration
GHOST DMPM is configured via `config/ghost_config.json`. A default configuration is generated if it doesn't exist.
Refer to `ghost_config.py` and the generated `config/ghost_config.json` for all options.

**Key Sections:**
*   `mvno_list`, `keywords`
*   `google_search_mode`, `api_keys` (Use environment variables for production secrets!)
*   `crawler`, `parser`, `database`
*   `dashboard` (Change default credentials!)
*   `logging`, `reports`
*   `webhooks`, `export`, `scheduler`, `analytics`

**Security Note:** For production, use environment variables for sensitive data like API keys and passwords rather than storing them directly in `ghost_config.json`.

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Basic Usage (Full Cycle)
```bash
python main.py
```
Output and logs are generated in respective directories (`reports/`, `logs/`, `data/`, `test_output/`).

### Natural Language Queries (via MCP)
1.  Start MCP server: `python ghost_mcp_server.py` (or via Docker Compose).
2.  Use `mcp_client.py`:
    ```bash
    python mcp_client.py --method get_top_mvnos --params '{"n": 5}'
    ```
    See `MCP_QUICKSTART.md` or [AI Integration Guide](docs/Integration.md).

### API Integration
-   **Direct Module Usage**: Import classes like `GhostCrawler` in Python.
-   **MCP Server**: Connect via WebSocket.
-   **Dashboard API**: RESTful endpoints (see `ghost_dashboard.py`).

### Webhook Setup
Configure in `config/ghost_config.json` under `webhooks`. Example:
```json
"webhooks": {
  "slack_url": "YOUR_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL",
  "email": { "smtp_server": "smtp.example.com", "smtp_user": "user" /* ... */ }
}
```
See `examples/webhook_setup.py`.

### Scheduled Reports
Configure in `config/ghost_config.json` under `scheduler.jobs`. Example:
```json
"scheduler": {
  "enabled": true,
  "jobs": [{ "name": "daily_brief", "cron_schedule": "0 2 * * *" /* ... */ }]
}
```
See `examples/automated_reports.py`.

## 🤖 AI Integration
GHOST DMPM integrates with AI platforms (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) via the **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server** (`ghost_mcp_server.py`).
