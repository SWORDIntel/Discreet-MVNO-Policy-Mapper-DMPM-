# Include data and other specific files if necessary
# Example: include data/my_data_file.dat
# For now, keeping it simple as per the plan.
# The .gitignore already handles /data, /logs, etc.
# MANIFEST.in is for what to *include* in source distributions.
# If data, logs, reports, test_output are meant to be created by the app
# and not part of the sdist, they don't need to be here.
# Config examples and templates are good to include.
